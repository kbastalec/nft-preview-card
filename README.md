## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Desktop-first workflow

### What I learned

I brushed my knowledge on [position property](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_positioning.asp), particularly

```css
.class {
  position: relative;
}
```

and

```css
.class {
  position: absolute;
}
```

### Useful resources

- [Image Overlay](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_image_overlay_title.asp) - This helped me set up the overlay effect on mouse hover
